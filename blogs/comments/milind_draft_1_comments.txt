1. Is starting with a quote fine? I am ok with it but I thought it is bad practice

2. I notice you said the emergence of reasoning. I should probably do some more research on the topic for sure. However,
are we limiting the fact that they are evolving based on reasoning. For instance a big step up was teaching LLMs coding
that way they didn't need to estimate math equations and moreover have the power of code to their advantage. May not be reasoning
but is certainly pertinent here.

3. Might be a good idea to give names for different levels (e.g. 1. Tool Chaining, 2. LLM driver 3. LLM thinker 4. LLM creator 5. AGI)
just a thought

4. Also I am confused as to what exactly 2 is. Is it just 1 but the LLM can handle multiple orchestrators


Tool-chaining with an external LLM:
    Most of this looks good but I am curious. Should you not mention that for an external LLM, the LLM is not actually making any decisions
    on how to go forward.
